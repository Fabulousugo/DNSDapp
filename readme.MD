# Decentralized Name registration and fund-transfer Application (DNS-Dapp)

# What does this do?

  - Manage name registry on decentralized platform (ethereum)
  - Buy/Sell via Bidding process for tamper-proof and best price mechanism
  - Transfer funds (ether) via names (registered)
  - Release names for a better price via bidding
    
# Use Cases:
  
1.  Checking the avaiability for a name
2.	Reserve a name if available, by sending a tx with amount of ether
3.	Release name by making it available (can be released only by their owners)
5.	Bid on names already taken (bids must be > original price)
7.	Owner of domain can change the ownership of the domain to the highest bidder
8.	Name can be used to send ether to its owner
